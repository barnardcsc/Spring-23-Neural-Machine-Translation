# Neural Machine Translation, Spring 2023

In this workshop, we will consider neural machine translation, with a focus on sequence to sequence models. We'll consider specifically a basic character-level recurrent sequence-to-sequence model and show how it can be applied across varying languages, and explore why the differences in language representation impact the aspects of the model. We will be coding in Python. No prior experience is required! Read [here](https://csc.barnard.edu/events/automatic-accent-insertion) for more information.
